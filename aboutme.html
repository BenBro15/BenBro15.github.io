      <p>  To start, I grew up in Winthrop Maine, and lived there all the way through high school.  My first two years of college at SMCC I commuted living in my own apartment in Winthrop.  The drive was about 50 minutes since I was attending the Brunswick campus, a campus with only four buildings and one parking lot. </p>
